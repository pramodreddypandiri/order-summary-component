Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### Useful resources

- [Tail Wind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
